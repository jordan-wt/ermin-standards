Tier 2 and 3 methods require more detailed data and/or measurements for their application. In cases where a national methodology exists, which is consistent with the IPCC Guidelines, it is highly advisable to use the national methodology. This methodology should be fully documented in order to allow the reader to understand why this particular method is better than the default one proposed by the IPCC.""
